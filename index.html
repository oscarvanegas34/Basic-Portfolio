            <img src="assets/images/bull-terrier.jpg" alt="My future dog">
            <p> My name is Oscar and the puppy in the image is my future dog. I was born and raised in Leon, Nicaragua. For those who don't know, it's a small
                and beautiful country in Central America. I growed up in a medium size family and I am the youngest
                of four brothers and sisters.</p>
            <p> Growing up I used to play a lot of different sports like: basketball, soccer, beisball,
                boxing and taekwondo. Don't worry I am not letal.</p>
            <p> I graduated as an <strong>Industrial Engineering</strong> after obtaining a scholarship playing basketball in college. 
                My hobbies are: workout, play basketball, play guitar and spend time with my family.</p>
            <p> I currently work as a Regional Customer Service Manager / Account Manager for a software company based
                in Johannesburg. I have a fascination about technology and it is the reason why I decided to enroll 
                in the coding botcamp at Georgia Tech.</p>
